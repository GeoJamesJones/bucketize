Thailand has long been called the kitchen of the world with its
abundant natural resources, highly-skilled workforce, and strength
in research. The food industry contributed roughly 23% of the
countrys GDP. The value of Thailands food industry, including
local consumption and exports, is expected to reach USD
102 billion in 2017.1 Thailand is also one of the largest
net food exporting countries in the world and the
second in Asia with a food trade balance at a record
value of USD 16.7 billion in 2016 2
In leveraging its geography with local
agricultural resources, the Thai
government designated the food
industry as one of ten key growth
engines in-line with the
Thailand 4.0 economic
model. The government
also created the food-
optimized industrial
park, known as
Food Innopolis.

FOOD INDUSTRY
With abundant natural resources, a year-round
growing season, relatively low labor costs, and
a skilled workforce, Thailand enjoys numerous
competitive advantages in the food and
agricultural industries. Roughly 50% of total land
area in the country is used for agricultural
purposes, allowing over 80% of raw materials
to be used in the food industry which can be
sourced locally at competitive prices.1
The
country is a top-ten global producer of some
important agricultural products including rice,
cassava, sugarcane, palm oil, coconut,
pineapple, and natural rubber.2

Food Processing
Hosting roughly 9,000 food processing companies in Thailand, the
country is the main producer and exporter for several processed
foods including canned tuna, frozen seafood, shrimp, and chicken.1
Processed food exports contribute about 52% of total food
exports and account for nearly 15% of Thai manufacturing
output.2
As one of the worlds leading producers of agricultural commodities,
Thailands food supply is large enough to serve the global market.
Raw materials are processed to increase the products shelf life and
quality. Thailand produced over 2.4 million tons of chicken and over
200,000 tons of shrimp in 2016, placing the country in the top five
globally as both a chicken and shrimp exporter. Approximately
70% of poultry production is locally consumed. This number is
expected to increase by 4-5% in 2017, from around 1.7 million tons
in 2016.3
Thailand also supplies various frozen seafood products such
as frozen cuttlefish and fish meat to serve consumers throughout
the world.

To further extend shelf life and add more value to local agricultural
and fisheries products, Thailand adopted canning, high-technology
freeze drying, and other preservation processes. The country
is recognized as the top exporter of many canned foods
such as canned pineapple and tuna. The country
exported over USD 2 billion in canned tuna
and USD 611 million in canned
pineapple in 2016 and stood as

    Urbanization and increasingly busy lifestyles are the main drivers of
the double-digit ready meal growth rate in Thailand. In addition to the
emerging local demand, Thailand is also a prime production base for
ready meals. The export value is expected to reach USD 167 million
in 2017 at a 12.4%annual growth rate. The country is currently the
9th
largest ready meal exporter in the world, accounting for a 3.7%
market share in 2016.1

With strong support from the government, Thai manufacturers are
investing considerable resources in research and development to
boost their productivity and efficiency. Many companies are using
computerized systems to control their production processes. Combined
with the changing lifestyles of consumers, purchases of processed
foods are rapidly growing. Ready meals, convenient meat and meat
products have shown both strong domestic and export demand.

increasing numbers of consumers are starting to take care of their
health at a younger age. The rapidly aging population is also
generating substantial growth in this market. The number of people
aged 65 or older is expected to reach nearly 1.5 billion in 2050.2
And based on a report from the United Nations, by 2030, the aging
population will account for 20% of Thailands total population.3

are formulated to treat diseases and disorders ranging from asthma
to diabetes. The medical food industry in Thailand is thriving. Many
leading global manufacturers have their facilities in Thailand,
including Mead Johnson Nutrition, Abbott, Novartis, and Thai
Otsuka. This sector directly benefits from the world-class reputation
of Thailands medical services industry as the country attracts
over two million foreign patients annually.4
